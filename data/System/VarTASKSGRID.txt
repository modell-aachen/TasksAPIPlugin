---+ TASKSGRID macro

This is a macro from [[TasksAPIPlugin]], used to render a list/grid of tasks.

%STARTINCLUDE%
Shows a table/grid view of tasks. Defaults to showing open tasks that have the
current topic as their context.

Example:

<verbatim class="tml">
%TASKSGRID{
  allowcreate="1"
  allowupload="1"
  form="MyTasksForm"
  showattachments="1"
}%
</verbatim>

The following parameters are available:

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| "..." (or context="...") | Context to search for. Only tasks with this context will be shown. Use =any= to show tasks from anywhere (in this case, setting a query is recommended to avoid getting an enormous list). | %<nop>WEB%.%<nop>TOPIC% |
| allowcreate="..." | Show a button to create a new task | 1 |
| allowupload="..." | In the task editor, render an interface to upload attachments | 1 |
| autoassign="..." | Key-Value pair to automatically assign a given user or group to a specified task state. See also =autoassigntarget= | Decision=Team,Information=Team |
| autoassigntarget="..." | Name of the form field holding the information about the person or group who's responsible for that specific task | !AssignedTo |
| captiontemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render the caption area | tasksapi::grid::caption |
| createlinktext="..." | Label of the button for creating new tasks | %<nop>MAKETEXT{"Add task"}% |
| depth="..." | Number of levels of child tasks to fetch. This will enable nested rendering of tasks. | 0 |
| desc="..." | Sorts the grid in descending order. | 1 |
| editortemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render the task editor | tasksapi::editor |
| filtertemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render the status filter widget | tasksapi::grid::filter::defaults |
| flavor="..." | Name of a task's template flavor to render each grid entry with | |
| form="..." | The form to use for new tasks (in =Web.Topic= format) | %<nop>SYSTEMWEB%.TasksAPIDefaultTaskForm |
| id="..." | Unique id to identify the .tasktracker DOM object | tracker-AUTOINC |
| keepclosed="..." | Keep closed tasks within the grid until next page load | 1 |
| offset="..." | When paging is enabled, skips the amount of entries specified. | 0 |
| order="..." | Name of form field to use for column ordering. Parameter order also accepts a JSON string for multi level ordering. Define an array of objects for which each object's key defines the form field name and it's value whether to sort ascending (=0=) or descending (=1=). E.g. <verbatim>order="[{\"Created\": 1}, {\"Title\": 0}]"</verbatim> | Created |
| pagesize="..." | Number of tasks to fetch per page | 25 |
| paging="..." | Enables pagination (next/prev links at the bottom of the tasks grid). Parameter 'paging' has a higher precedence than parameter 'infinite'. Note: you should set a proper page size as well | 1 |
| parent="..." | Provide the ID of a task to show its children only, an empty string (or omit) to show only top-level tasks, or =any= to display all tasks that match the other criteria. (This does not automatically activate display of nested tasks; the parent itself will not be shown. If you want to use nested tasks, look at the =depth= parameter instead.) | |
| query="..." | An additional query object in JSON format to combine with the query generated from the other parameters. The values covered by other parameters should not be specified again in this query; anything could happen if you do. | |
| readonly="..." | Renders a grid readonly. Disables creation/editing of tasks. Denies uploading attachments | 0 |
| showattachments="..." | Show number of attachments for each task | 1 |
| sortable="..." | Enables sorting of tasks within a grid | 1 |
| states="..." | The options available in the status filter widget in =select+values+ format. The key should match a valid task state (one or more of 'open', 'closed', 'deleted', 'all'). | %<nop>MAKETEXT{"open"}%=open,%<nop>MAKETEXT{"closed"}%=closed,%<nop>MAKETEXT{"all"}%=all |
| tasktemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render a task entry | tasksapi::task |
| template="..." | The name of the task grid template | tasksapi::grid |
| templatefile="..." | Name of the template file to be read before applying templates | %<nop>SYSTEMWEB%.TasksAPITemplate |
| title="..." | Title of the tasks grid | %<nop>MAKETEXT{"Tasks"}% |
| titlelength="..." | Number of characters before a task's title gets trancuated. Set to =0= to disable title length restrictions. | 100 |
| updateurl="..." | An URL used for async grid loading. | |
