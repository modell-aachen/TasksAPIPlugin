---+ TASKSGRID macro

This is a macro from [[TasksAPIPlugin]], used to render a list/grid of tasks.

%STARTINCLUDE%
Shows a table/grid view of tasks. Defaults to showing open tasks that have the
current topic as their context.

Example:

<verbatim>
%TASKSGRID{
  allowcreate="1"
  allowupload="1"
  form="MyTasksForm"
  showattachments="1"
}%
</verbatim>

The following parameters are available:

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| "..." (or context="...") | Context to search for. Only tasks with this context will be shown. Use =any= to show tasks from anywhere (in this case, setting a query is recommended to avoid getting an enormous list). | %<nop>WEB%.%<nop>TOPIC% |
| allowcreate="..." | Show a button to create a new task | 0 |
| allowupload="..." | In the task editor, render an interface to upload attachments | 0 |
| captiontemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render the caption area | tasksapi::caption |
| createlinktext="..." | Label of the button for creating new tasks | %<nop>MAKETEXT{"Add task"}% |
| depth="..." | Number of levels of child tasks to fetch. This will enable nested rendering of tasks. | 0 |
| editortemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render the task editor | tasksapi::editor |
| filtertemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render the status filter widget | tasksapi::grid::filter |
| form="..." | The form to use for new tasks (in =Web.Topic= format) | %<nop>SYSTEMWEB%.TasksAPIDefaultForm |
| order="..." | Which field to sort by. | (undefined sort order) |
| pagesize="..." | Number of tasks to fetch per page | 100 |
| parent="..." | Provide the ID of a task to show its children only, an empty string (or omit) to show only top-level tasks, or =any= to display all tasks that match the other criteria. (This does not automatically activate display of nested tasks; the parent itself will not be shown. If you want to use nested tasks, look at the =depth= parameter instead.) | |
| query="..." | An additional query object in JSON format to combine with the query generated from the other parameters. The values covered by other parameters should not be specified again in this query; anything could happen if you do. | |
| showattachments="..." | Show existing attachments for each task | 0 |
| states="..." | The options available in the status filter widget in =select+values+ format. The key should match a valid task state (one or more of 'open', 'closed', 'deleted', 'all') | %<nop>MAKETEXT{"open"}%=open,%<nop>MAKETEXT{"closed"}%=closed,%<nop>MAKETEXT{"all"}%=all |
| stateless="..." | Enable to hide the status filter widget | 0 |
| tasktemplate="..." | Name of the template used to render a task entry | tasksapi::task |
| templatefile="..." | Name of the template file to be read before applying templates | TasksAPITemplate |
| title="..." | Title of the tasks grid | %<nop>MAKETEXT{"Tasks"}% |
